A text editor with the following features:

1. Each enter will create a new paragraph. 

2. The user can drag and drop the paragraphs to rearrange their order. 

3. On double-clicking a word or selecting some text, a tooltip with three options appears: make the word bold, underlined, and change the text color to Red. 

4. Users can enter links in the text editor by using tags. For example, “<a>This is a link </a>”. When the user clicks “Done”, the editor  detects if the user has entered a link tag in the editor. If so, it adds it as an actual link (like this: This is a link (http://www.google.com/)) to the bottom of the page (outside of the text editor). The links at the bottom of the page are colored red and blue alternatively, and they do not actually link to another site. 

5. Can Replace all the four letter words in the editor with the random words generated by using the link:

Note: 5th feature is being worked upon and not yet fully functional.
